<h1 style="text-align:center;">BETTY NEUMAN (NEUMAN SYSTEMS MODEL)</h1>
<h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-Born in 1924 and grew up on a farm in Ohio. Her rural background helped her develop a compassion for the people in need.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-She completed her initial nursing education with double honors at Peoples Hospital of Nursing in 1947</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-As a young nurse, Neuman moved to California and worked in a variety of roles that included hospital nurse, school nurse, industrial nurse, and clinical instructor at the University of Southern California Medical Center.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-Neuman was a pioneer of nursing involvement in mental health.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-She and Donna Aquilina were the first two nurses to develop the nurse counselor role within community crisis centers in Los Angeles.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-She developed, taught, and refined a community mental health program for post master’s degree level nurses at UCLA.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-Neuman first published her model during early 1970’s. The first edition of The Neuman Systems Model: Application to Nursing Education and Practice was published in 1982; further development and revisions of the model are illustrated in subsequent editions (Neuman, 1989, 1995, 2002, 2011).</p>
<p><b>
<h2>THEORETICAL SOURCES OF NEUMAN SYSTEM MODEL</h2>
</p></b>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-The Neuman Systems Model is based on <i>General System Theory</i> and reflects the nature of living organisms as open system in interaction with each other and with the environment. Within this model, Neuman synthesize knowledge from several from several disciplines and incorporates her own philosophical beliefs and clinical nursing expertise, particulary in mental health.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-The model draws from <i><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Gestalt-psychology"}>Gestalt Theory</a></i>, which describe homeostasis as the process by which an organism maintains in equilibrium, and consequently its health, under varying condition. Neuman describes adjustment as the process by which the organisms satisfies its needs.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-The model is also derived from the <i>philosophical view of de Chardin and Marx</i>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_philosophy">Marxist philosophy</a> suggests that the properties of parts are determined partly by the larger wholes within dynamically organized system. Within this view, Neuman confirm that the pattern of the whole influence awareness of the pen, which is drawn from <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/TEITFO#:~:text=At%20the%20center%20of%20his,and%20purpose%20in%20the%20universe.">de Chardin’s philosophy of the wholeness of life</a>.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-Neuman adapts the concept of levels of prevention from <i>Caplan’s Conceptual Model (1964)</i> and relates these preventions to nursing: primary prevention, secondary prevention, and tertiary prevention.</p>

<h2>BETTY NEUMAN’S CONTRIBUTION TO NURSING THEORY: NEUMAN SYSTEMS MODEL</h2>
</p></b>
<p style="font-family:arial;">-In 1970 she began developing her Systems Model as a way to teach introductory nursing to students by giving them a holistic view of patients that included the physiological, psychological, sociological, and developmental aspects.</p>

<h2>METAPARADIGM OF THE NEUMAN’S SYSTEM MODEL</h2>
<h3>1. Nursing</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal">-Neuman believes that nursing is concerned with the whole person. She views nursing as a “unique profession in that it is concerned with all the variables affecting in individual’s response to stress.” The nurse’s perception influences the care given; therefore, Neuman states that the perceptual field of the caregiver and the client must be assessed.</p>
<h3>2. Person</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal">-Neuman presents the concept of human beings as an open client system in reciprocal interaction with the environment. The client may be an individual, family, group, community, or social issue. The client system is a dynamic composite of interrelationships among physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual factors.</p>
<h3>3. Health</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal">-Neuman considers her work a wellness model. She views health as a continuum of wellness to illness that is dynamic in nature and is constantly changing. Neuman states that “Optimal wellness or stability indicates that total system needs are being met. A reduced state of wellness is the result of unmet systemic needs.</p>
<h3>4. Environment</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal">-Neuman defines environment as all the internal and external factors that surround the influence the client system.</p>
<p><b>
<h2>MAJOR CONCEPTS & DEFINITION</h2>
<h3>1. Wholistic Approach</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">	The Neuman Systems Model is a dynamic, open, systems approach to client care originally developed to provide a unifying focus for defining nursing problems and for understanding the client in interaction with the environment. The client system may be defined as a person, family, group, community, or social issue.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">	Clients are viewed as wholes whose parts are in dynamic interaction. The model considers all variables simultaneously affecting the clients system: physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual. She changed the spelling of the term <i>holistic</i> to <i>wholistic</i> to enhance understanding if the term as referring to the whole person.</p>
<h3>2. Open System</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">According to Neuman, a system is open when “there is a continuous flow of input and process, output, and feedback. Stress and reaction to stress are basic components.</p>
<h3>3. Environment</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">As defined by Neuman, “the environment consist of both internal and external forces surrounding the client, influencing and being influenced by the client, at any point in time.” The environment is a vital arena that is germane to the system and its function. The environment may be viewed as all factors that affect and are affected by the system.</p>
<p><b>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">In Neuman Systems Model identifies three relevant environments: (1) internal, (2) external, and (3) created.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;"> •	The internal environment exists within the client system. All forces and interactive influences that are solely within the client system’s boundaries make up this environment.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;"> •	The external environment exists outside the client system.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;"> •	The created environment is unconsciously developed and is used by the client to support protective coping.</p> 
<h3>4. Health</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">In Neuman’s nursing theory, Health is defined as the condition or degree of system stability and is viewed as a continuum from wellness to illness. When system needs are met, optimal wellness exists. When needs are not satisfied, illness exists. When the energy needed to support life is not available, death occurs.</p>
<h3>5. Client System</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">Neuman views the individual client holistically and considers the variables simultaneously and comprehensively.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	The <i><b>physiological variable</i></b> refers to the structure and functions of the body.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	The <i><b>psychological variable</i></b> refers to mental processes and relationships.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	The <i><b>sociocultural variable</i></b> refers to system functions that relate to social and cultural expectations and activities.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	The <i><b>developmental variable</i></b> refers to those processes related to development over the lifespan.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	The <i><b>spiritual variable</i></b> refers to the influence of spiritual beliefs.</p>
<h2>THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE MODEL</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">The client as a system is composed of a central core surrounded by concentric rings. The inner circle of the diagram represents the basic survival factors common to human beings. A series of broken rings surrounding the basic core structure are called the <i>lines of resistance</i>. These rings represent resource factors that help the client defend against a stressor.

<h3>6. Normal Line of Defense</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">The normal line of defense is the model’s outer solid circle. An adaptational level of health developed over time and is considered normal for a particular individual client or system; it becomes a standard for wellness-deviance determination.</p>
<h3>7. Flexible Line of Defense</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">A protective accordion-like mechanism that surrounds and protects the normal line of defense from the invasion by stressors. Neuman describes the flexible line of defense as the “client system’s first protective mechanism.”</p>
<h3>8. Stressors</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">Stressors are tension-producing stimuli that have the potential to disrupt system stability, leading to an output come that may be positive or negative. They may arise from the following:</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	<b>Intrapersonal forces</b> – occuring within the individual.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	<b>Interpersonal forces</b> – occuring between one or more individuals.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	<b>Extrapersonal forces</b> – occuring outside the individual.</p>
<h3>9. Degree of Reaction</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">The degree of reaction represents system instability that occurs when stressors invade the normal line of defense.</p>
<h3>10. Prevention as Intervention</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">Interventions are purposeful actions to help the client retain, attain, or maintain stability. They can occur before or after the protective lines of defense and resistance are penetrated. Neuman identifies three levels of intervention:</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	<b>Primary Intervention</b>: is used when a stressor is suspected or identified. <i>A reaction has not yet occurred</i>, but the degree of risk is known. The purpose is to reduce the possibility of encounter with the stressor or to decrease the possibility of a reaction.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	<b>Secondary Intervention</b>: involves the intervention or treatment initiated <i>after symptoms from the stress have occurred</i>. The client’s internal and external resources are used to strengthen internal lines of resistance, reduce the reaction, and increase resistance factors.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">•	<b>Tertiary Intervention</b>: occurs after the active treatment or secondary prevention stage. It focuses on readjustment toward optimal client system stability. The goal is to maintain optimal wellness by preventing recurrence of reaction or regression. Tertiary prevention tends to lead back to primary prevention.</p>
<h3>11. Reconstitution</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-weight:normal; font-size:16px;">Reconstitution occurs after treatment for stressor reaction. It represents return of the system to stability, which may be at a higher or lower level of wellness than before stressor invasion.</p>
